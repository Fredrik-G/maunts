# maunts - Google Spreadsheet
This is the Google Apps Script for use with Google Spreadsheet and looking up mounts.

### Usage
Add this script to your spreadsheet and use it by assigning a cell to the function "readMaunts".
For example: "=readMaunts("character", "realm", $C$1:$N$1)", where the last parameter is a set of bosses. Check the screenshot below.
(Note: This is my first time using javascript/Google Apps Script and the code is far from good.)
